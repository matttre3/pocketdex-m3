Welcome to my Pokedex React App! This project is a React application that leverages the PokeAPI to showcase the first-generation Pok√©mon. It's designed for easy exploration, allowing users to filter by type, search, and view detailed information for each Pok√©mon.

<h2>Project Highlights</h2>

- List View: Stylish cards display all first-generation Pok√©mon for easy navigation.

- Type Filtering: Filter Pok√©mon by their types for a personalized experience.
  
- Advanced Search: Quickly find your favorite Pok√©mon or those with specific traits using the search bar.
  
- Pok√©mon Details: Clicking on a Pok√©mon card opens a detailed page with statistics, weaknesses, and strengths.
  
- React Routing: Smooth navigation between the main list and detailed pages with `React Router`.
  
- React Hooks: Extensive use of `useState` and `useEffect` to manage application state and `fetch` data from the API.
  
- Tailwind CSS: The entire project's styling is crafted with Tailwind CSS, offering a fresh approach to UI design.
